# Missing 404 Route in React Router Dom

This example demonstrates a common issue in React Router applications:  not handling invalid routes.  When a user navigates to a URL that doesn't have a matching route, the application defaults to a blank page.  Adding a 404 route fixes this issue, providing a better user experience.  This repo shows the problem and the solution using React Router's `Route` component.
